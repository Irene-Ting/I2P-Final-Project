# Oh Burrow
> This is my final project of Introduction to Programming 2
## Proposal
- Name of the Game:
Oh Burrow
- Abstract:
The player is expected to arrive at the exit of the burrow before running out of the energy. Burrow is the place the player can walk and the energy will randomly appear in it. The player can also dig the burrow wall to shorten the distance between the entrance and the exit. While the hard burrow wall is able to be dug only by tools, the soft one can be dug by costing energy. Every time you dig, it's possible to gain some money, which is essential to buy tools.
